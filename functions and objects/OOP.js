// procedural programming => has set of data and functions
// OOP => we combine group of related variables and functions into a unit. vars= properites, funcs=methods. we call that unit object.
// grouping related data is called encapsualation.

// hiding properites and methods from the outside to 
// reduce complexity. this is abstraction.
// this makes the interface of the object simpler.
// also helps us reduce the impact of change.

// inheritence => reduce redundancy

// poly = many, more = one
// polymorphism = many from
// helps us stuff reducing if/else
